OASIS Universal Business Language
=================================

UBL is designed to provide a universally understood and recognized commercial syntax for legally binding business documents and to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based  infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes. UBL is freely available to everyone without legal encumbrance or licensing fees.

Please refer to the official [open-oasis.org](http://oasis-open.org/) site for the full documentation for [UBL v2.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.0/UBL-2.0.html) and [UBL v2.1](http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.1/UBL-2.1.html)

## Getting started
In order to you to include this software in your own project, you must first specify the dependency on the artifact. The most current version is `2.1.0` and it is backwards compatible with `2.0.0`.

### Using the UBL XML Schemas with Maven

```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.tradeshift</groupId>
    <artifactId>tradeshift-ubl-xsd</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.0</version>
  </dependency>
```

### Using the UBL XML Schemas with SBT
```sbt
libraryDependencies +=
  "com.tradeshift" %% "tradeshift-ubl-xsd" % "2.1.0"
```

### Using the UBL XML Schemas with Gradle
```gradle
dependencies {
  compile 'com.tradeshift:tradeshift-ubl-xsd:2.1.0'
}
```

## What is included?
The artifact only contains the XML Schemas (XSD) of the Universal Business Language standard. This repository contains an amount of [examples](blob/v2.1.x/src/test/resources/org/oasis-open/ubl/examples) that can be a starting point for your learning of UBL.



## Examples
The UBL language is a fairly big specification and it's quickly easy to get lost if you start out digging directly into the XSDs. However here is a few links to few common document types:


 * [Order](blob/v2.1.x/src/test/resources/org/oasis-open/ubl/examples/UBL-CreditNote-2.1-Example.xml)

 * [Minimal Invoice](blob/v2.1.x/src/test/resources/org/oasis-open/ubl/examples/UBL-Invoice-2.1-Example-Trivial.xml)

 * [Credit Note](blob/v2.1.x/src/test/resources/org/oasis-open/ubl/examples/UBL-CreditNote-2.1-Example.xml)
